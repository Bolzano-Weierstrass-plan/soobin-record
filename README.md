| ***2*** | True | My first day of adopting the dynamic scheduling rule. Ay the beginning of the day, I sat down and thought through about my schedule for the day, and decided upon five items: 1) debugging my [GSoC project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools), 2) 20 push-ups, 3) creating the alpha version of [PermaThreads](https://github.com/permathreads), 4) watching Neetcode data structure videos, and (5) doing Leetcode sets listed on Neetcode. |
