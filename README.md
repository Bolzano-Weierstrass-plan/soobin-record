| ***48*** | True | |
| ***47*** | Fail | I did all three walks today, but ironically failed my main rules. So, one more walk. |
| ***46*** | True | Three more walks to do (self-enforced). |
| ***45*** | True | |
| ***44*** | False | Six more walks to do (self-enforced). |
| ***43*** | True | |
| ***42*** | True | |
| ***41*** | Fail | |
| ***40*** | Fail | I have failed 14 times including this one. I have walked around the campus seven times, so I still have seven more walking to do. |

| ***30*** | False | Couldn't do Rule #2 and #3, but visited MIT for the weekend and won [HackMIT Grand Prize 3rd place](https://www.youtube.com/live/WAunf1TDzao?si=OKwnCPYuqZj6cJgb&t=25m36s). Met a lot of cool people โฅ๏ธโฅ๏ธโฅ๏ธ |

| ***28*** | False | |
| ***27*** | False | |
| ***26*** | False | I wans't able to do 20 minutes of PermaThreads development. It was a good 8-day streak until yesterday. Hopefully, I'll have nice streaks again. |
| ***25*** | True | |
| ***24*** | True | |
| ***23*** | True | |
| ***22*** | True | For my *Ethical Issues in Tech* class, I watched [The Social Dillema](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). It's the best documentary I've ever watched in my life. |
| ***21*** | True | |
| ***20*** | True | |
| ***19*** | True | |
| ***18*** | True | I've discovered that whenever I encounter a problem to solve, it's helpful to think about the problem while walking. If walking is not available, then watching a light YouTube video helps, too. |
| ***17*** | False | Same as Day 7. Couldn't finish Rule #3. On the flip side, I finished my [Google Summer of Code](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools). |

| ***9*** | True | |
| ***8*** | False | |
| ***7*** | False | Same again as Day 3 / Day 5. However, I fixed a bug in [Nsustain Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com/blob/main/src/docker/compose.yaml) where the port 80 (http) and 443 (https) are not forwarding at all if I run it from a remote server instead of my usual local server. Also, I've finished 80% of migrating from $24/month `one node of 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage` DigitalOcean Kubernetes to a $8/month `3 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage` Hetzner VPS because I realized I don't need the horitzontal scalability of K8s at least for the forseeable future, and this allows me to get a single server with more power and less money. |
| ***6*** | False | |
| ***5*** | False | Did well with Rule #1 and Rule #2, but couldn't do three out of five of my daily stuff, just like Day 3. Overall, it was satisfactory though because I got a lot of [Nsustain](https://github.com/nsustain) maintenance stuff done. |
| ***4*** | True | |
| ***3*** | False | I had success with Rule #1 and Rule #2, but broke Rule #3 because I couldn't work on three out of five of my daily dynamic-schedule items. To play devil's advocate, I had to spend ten hours moving. Nonetheless, I feel like I could have done better. |
| ***2*** | True |  |
| ***1*** | True | My first day of adopting the dynamic scheduling rule. Ay the beginning of the day, I sat down and thought through all of my schedule for the day, and decided upon five items: 1) debugging my [GSoC project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools), 2) 20 push-ups, 3) creating the alpha version of [PermaThreads](https://github.com/permathreads), 4) watching Neetcode data structure videos, and (5) doing Leetcode sets listed on Neetcode. |
| ***0*** | True | August 18, 2023. The day all of this began. |

# This is the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan

> The name Bolzano-Weierstrass plan is inspired by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that things getting closer to each other eventually converges.

A lot of things we do in our own life everyday, we do them not because we want to, but because we have these habits that have been formed witout us knowing at all.
Most often the case, a lot of these are not the way we want our lives to be, and yet, we spend hundreds or thousands of hours doing these things we're not even consciously aware of.
We wanted to change that.
In a world full of distractions, we wanted to ***lead*** our own life.

We've had many attempts like this before, and after countless failures, we realized it's crucial to make achievable goals and also have some kind of mechanism where we keep each other accountable.
Thus, our main philosophy here is for each of us to make three rules for ourselves and to do so in a way that we continuously encourage each other -- hence the ***Rules*** listed below.

A wise man once said, "you need 21 days to form a habit."
So, here's our plan.
We try our best to make these rules our habits.
Do not make them too hard.
Otherwise, we might fail yet again.
Make the right thing the easy thing to do.
Form a group, ***and call it the Bolzano-Weierstrass plan***, and create self-enforced consequences for failing to follow the rules.
Hold each other accountable.
Help each other live the life they want to live.

<br>
<br>
<br>

***Overview***<br>
- Each of us gets to choose our own rules.
Make them as specific, objective, and measurable as possible.
We need to know exactly when we're following our own rules, and when we are not.
Otherwise, our future-self might be able to move the boundaries however our future-self wants, which is not what we want here.
- Everyday, each of us must create a status report and commit it to each of our `<name>-record` repository.
- Try to make the penalties small enough that we never feel like giving up and big enough that we strongly feel the consequences whenever we fail to follow our own rules.
- Any of the rules can be modified, if and only if all of the members explicitly give consent.

<br>

***Penalities***<br>
- `Deepak` `Soobin`: For each violation of the rules, walk around the entire Augie campus by the day after the violation.
- `tlu22`: For each violation of the rules, run around the entire Augie campus by the day after the violation.
- `@all`: If the penalty was not enforced for any reason - e.g. being too busy - then +1 each day.
- `Deepak` `Soobin`: For each violation of the rules, reserve $10 to take tlu22 out for fun time (food, etc).
In return, tlu22 must give a referral to Deepak and Soobin, if tlu22 becomes a top executive in a company, and if Deepak and Soobin are in the need of a company referral.

## Rules

#### tlu22's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/tlu22-record)]
1. 3 hours of math a day. No irralevent web browsing and phone use during math time.
2. no phone in bed, no gaming/video watching/web browsing before 2pm or after 11pm.
3. same as Soobin's second rule.

#### Deepak's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/deepak-record)]
1. No usage of mobile phone during focus times unless it is an emergency. Focus times include **work time**, **study time**, or any other dedicated times.
2. Gym for at least three hours every week, and calorie intake of 2500 - 3000 calories per day based on the heaviest meal calorie count of the day.
3. Same as Soobin's third rule.

#### Soobin's Rules [[Daily Record](https://github.com/Bolzano-Weierstrass-plan/soobin-record)]
1. Same as Deepak's Rule #1.
During the times I dedicate for a specific TODO, such as coding or exercising but excluding trival activities like eating or sleeping, the rule is to never open the phone unless I get a notification.
In the case of someone contacting me, I should only use, for example, the Call app.
Never leave the app of origin.
Close the phone as soon as it's done.
3. Every day, sit down without any kind of distractions, including but not limited to phones and laptops, for at least 10 minutes.
It must be in the sitting-down position.
Never lay down during the meditation because I tend to fall asleep if I do that.
4. This rule was first created by Deepak, and I just added some small bits to it.
The problem of scheduling our day is that there are too many unexpected factors that affect our schedule all the time.
Thus, we're doing what we call dynamic scheduling.
As opposed to static scheduling in which we have to follow every schedule minute by minute, dynamic shceduling takes all of those unexpected variables into account.
With dynamic scheduling, we're allowed to change the order in which we do those and at which time we do it, even how much time we do it.
As long as we do it for at least some amount of time, which in my case is defined as 10 minutes, then it's counted as a success.
