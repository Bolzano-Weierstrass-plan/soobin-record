| ***day*** | ***isSuccessful*** | ***notes*** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ***5*** | | WIP |
| ***4*** | True | |
| ***3*** | False | I had success with Rule #1 and Rule #2, but broke Rule #3 because I couldn't work on three out of five of my daily dynamic-schedule items. To play devil's advocate, I had to spend ten hours moving. Nonetheless, I feel like I could have done better. |
| ***2*** | True |  |
| ***1*** | True | My first day of adopting the dynamic scheduling rule. Ay the beginning of the day, I sat down and thought through all of my schedule for the day, and decided upon five items: 1) debugging my [GSoC project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools), 2) 20 push-ups, 3) creating the alpha version of [PermaThreads](https://github.com/permathreads), 4) watching Neetcode data structure videos, and (5) doing Leetcode sets listed on Neetcode. |
| ***0*** | True | August 18, 2023. The day all of this began. |
