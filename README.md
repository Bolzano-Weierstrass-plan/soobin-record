| ***day*** | ***isSuccessful*** | ***notes*** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ***23*** | | WIP |
| ***22*** | True | |
| ***21*** | True | |
| ***20*** | True | |
| ***19*** | True | |
| ***18*** | True | I've discovered that whenever I encounter a problem to solve, it's helpful to think about the problem while walking. If walking is not available, then watching a light YouTube video helps, too. |
| ***17*** | False | Same as Day 7. Couldn't finish Rule #3. On the flip side, I finished my [Google Summer of Code](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools). |
| ***16*** | False | |
| ***15*** | True | |
| ***14*** | True | |
| ***13*** | True | |
| ***12*** | True | |
| ***11*** | True | |
| ***10*** | True | |
| ***9*** | True | |
| ***8*** | False | |
| ***7*** | False | Same again as Day 3 / Day 5. However, I fixed a bug in [Nsustain Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com/blob/main/src/docker/compose.yaml) where the port 80 (http) and 443 (https) are not forwarding at all if I run it from a remote server instead of my usual local server. Also, I've finished 80% of migrating from $24/month `one node of 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage` DigitalOcean Kubernetes to a $8/month `3 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage` Hetzner VPS because I realized I don't need the horitzontal scalability of K8s at least for the forseeable future, and this allows me to get a single server with more power and less money. |
| ***6*** | False | |
| ***5*** | False | Did well with Rule #1 and Rule #2, but couldn't do three out of five of my daily stuff, just like Day 3. Overall, it was satisfactory though because I got a lot of [Nsustain](https://github.com/nsustain) maintenance stuff done. |
| ***4*** | True | |
| ***3*** | False | I had success with Rule #1 and Rule #2, but broke Rule #3 because I couldn't work on three out of five of my daily dynamic-schedule items. To play devil's advocate, I had to spend ten hours moving. Nonetheless, I feel like I could have done better. |
| ***2*** | True |  |
| ***1*** | True | My first day of adopting the dynamic scheduling rule. Ay the beginning of the day, I sat down and thought through all of my schedule for the day, and decided upon five items: 1) debugging my [GSoC project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools), 2) 20 push-ups, 3) creating the alpha version of [PermaThreads](https://github.com/permathreads), 4) watching Neetcode data structure videos, and (5) doing Leetcode sets listed on Neetcode. |
| ***0*** | True | August 18, 2023. The day all of this began. |
